# Chainpals
Secure Crypto Payments.
# What is Chainpals?
Chainpals is the platform that helps you to carry out your crypto payments securely. You can do instant transactions or milestone-based transactions with Chainpals. In case of any issues, you can raise a dispute & get a resolution. Chainpals enable safe & secured payment solutions using smart contracts & blockchain technology.
# Different Types of Payments
There are mainly two types of payments offered by Chainpals, and they are as under:

## üí∏ Instant Payments
As the name suggests, instant payment is used for a quick payment that has two steps to create transaction. The payment is made to the smart contract and is stored in the smart contract for pre-defined days. 

Buyer needs to raise any issues they have within pre-defined days (Buyer/Seller can select the number of days to auto-release payment when creating the transaction). If any issue is raised before the pre-defined days, the escrow manager will jump in and resolve them for you. If it's not resolved, the refund will be issued based on the resolution provided by the escrow manager. 

You would be able to see the summary of the transaction and will receive the notification emails from time to time based on the events making it very simple to transact.

## üìù Milestone Based Payments

Milestone-based payment is mainly used for transactions with more significant amounts where you will be releasing the amount based on milestones reached and verification of the same. Defining milestone payment transactions is three steps process.

First, the buyer/seller needs to determine the milestone and payout along with the terms & conditions and agreement. 

Second, the buyer and seller both agree to the terms, and then the buyer needs to transfer the amount to the smart contract. The seller then will start working towards the milestones.

Third, the seller marks the milestone as completed. The buyer gets the notification and views the milestone marked as completed. If the buyer is happy, he will confirm the milestone as completed, and the payment will be released to the seller, which is an irreversible action.

If the buyer isn‚Äôt happy, he can send messages to the seller, and if they disagree, then they can raise the dispute and bring the resolution or the transaction can be canceled.

# üí°Token Utilities

1) Fee Discount:  You get discounted fees if you decide to pay the transaction fee via Chainpals token. This is the way to save yourself extra transaction fees while enjoying the security and escrow features of the platform. These are perks of owning Chainpals token.
2) Staking (Passive Earning): If you stake the Chainpals token, you get the part of transaction fees which will be distributed to the staking contract. This way, we distribute profits to the community.
3) Governance: Chainpals is a community-focused platform. With Chainpals token, you would enjoy voting rights to the upcoming proposals. You would also have the ability to vote for top escrow managers who would be an essential and critical part of the Chainpals ecosystem.
4) Pre-defined token burn mechanism: 50% of the token supply will get burned in phases. Therefore, this mechanism will result in an increase in the token valuation over time. Thus Chainpals tokens are designed keeping in mind the benefit of token holders.
5) Referral System: With a referral system, you would be able to refer your friends and families and earn a part of the fees they pay for using the Chainpals system. In addition, we have a unique NFT-based referral system in place where you get eligible for referral NFT and earn more.
